				<h2> Time Travel </h2>
				<p> Many Science Fiction books fall under the sub-genre of time travel. In these books,
				a major part of the plot includes traveling forwards or backwards in time and the resulting consequences of doing either. The
				subgenre was first popularized by HG Wells when he wrote "The Time Machine". </p>
				<h2> Dystopian Sci-Fi</h2>
				<p> In Dystopian Science Fiction, the main plot is centralized around a society that is somehow corrupt (by the authors standards). Most often,
				these books are created to depict an aspect of futuristic probability that is meant to shock the readers into a more profound understanding of an issue at hand.
				One example of a famous dystopian science fiction book would be "1984" by George Orwell, who wrote the novel to bring attention to the government's involvement in our lives.</p>
				<h2> Mainstream Sci-Fi </h2>
				<p> Mainstream science fiction, in the past, would be described as less of a subgenre and more of an overarching depiction of sci-fi as a whole, however,
				now that technological advancements are being made every day, a pattern has surfaced. Mainstream literature in this day and age is about realities where artificial intelligence is 
				part of everyday life. Some of these realities convey fear of the future, while others touch on the evergrowing potential that a cyberfuture may hold. An example could be "Ready Player One"
				by Ernest Cline.</p>
