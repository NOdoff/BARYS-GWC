</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="In the beginning" tags="" position="3110,568" size="100,100">In the beginning, you feel nothing. No sensation, no emotion, nothing. 

As the grip of sleep slowly loosens from your mind, you notice two things, one more pressing than the other. First, you are most definitely not in your room. Instead of plush carpet, you feel hard, wooden floorboards under your feet. Second, you are unbelievably cold. 

Your eyes fly open at that and you find yourself standing in the middle of an entirely bare room, save for two ornate doors across the floor. One has the word &#39;Bathroom&#39; scrawled across the top pannels, and the other is not labled. Which do you open?

[[Open the bathroom door.|Low Fantasy Path]]

[[Open the //other// door.|Magical Realism and High Fantasy Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Low Fantasy Path" tags="" position="2745,764" size="100,100">//You are now beginning the Low Fantasy Path//

--

You walk across the room and open the bathroom door. 

Peering inside, you see a toilet, a sink, a mirror, and a strangely fascinating medicine cabinet. You can&#39;t exactly pinpint what about it you find noteworthy, but the itch to open it gets stronger by the second. 

With great anticipation, you fling open the cabinet door. The only thing you find inside is a vile of red, swirling liquid, and again, an urge overtakes you. 

You grab the vile, pop it open, and tip the unidentified liquid into your mouth. It goes down your throat like ice and you take a moment to cough into your hand before looking up once again to see that the toilet has been replaced with a stark white door. 

[[Open the new door.|Continue the Low Fantasy Path]]

[[Go back to the beginning.|In the beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Magical Realism and High Fantasy Path" tags="" position="3474,753" size="100,100">You pad across the floor on sure feet and reach the non-descript door in a matter of steps. Testing the handle reveals that it is unlocked, and you push it open with ease. 

Once you step through the threshold, you allow yourself to look around. 

You seem to be standing in a sparsely furnished living room, in fact, the only things in this room worth noting are two more doors, one leading further into the house, towards what you can only assume to be the kitchen, and the other leading outside.

[[Go into the kitchen.|Magical Realism Path]]

[[Go outside.|High Fantasy Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Continue the Low Fantasy Path" tags="" position="2298,766" size="100,100">Walking through the toilet-turned-door brings you to an alleyway lit by two medival-looking sconces on either side of a storefront before you. 

Above the red door leading into the shop, a weathered sign reads: &#39;Holmes Bathroom Emporium&#39;. 

Turning away from the store, you feel compelled to turn your eyes to the cobblestone sidewalk, where there is an entrance to the city&#39;s sewage network, with its cover ajar. 

[[Go into the shop.|Shop Path]]

[[Enter the sewer.|Sewer Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Shop Path" tags="" position="1846,796" size="100,100">You take five steps and are in front of the shop door. Suddenly your palms start sweating and your heart begins to race with adrenaline, there is something special about this shop. 

You grab hold of the carved, golden handle and pull the door open. 

When you were standing outside, you believed that the shop would be quite small, with a few windows, maybe a backdoor. You did //not// expect to find yourself standing before a room fit to house a giant.

You gap at the setting before you, speachless at its grandness.

floor to ceiling windows lin the walls, allowing rays of sunlight to filter in, giving the room an etheral glow (you know for a fact that outside, the sky is an overcast gray). 

Colorful painted patterns climb the walls, covering every corner of the room in frivilous bursts and bold splashes. 

The most impressive aspect, however, is the sheer number of //things//. Piles of assorted knick knacks tower over you, threatening to bury you in jewels and junk. As you peer around the first pile, you see that the rest of the room is much the same. You can barely see the floor, for seemingly every square inch has become a resting ground for one object or another. 

You&#39;re so overcome by the view this room provides that you entirely miss the figure moving towards you, and only realize their presence when they speak.

&quot;Hello dear, I see you found the vial I left in your bathroom.&quot; 

The whispy voice reaches your ears and you jolt back. 

//Vial?//

[[Question the mysterious being.|Shop 2 Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Sewer Path" tags="" position="2100,961" size="100,100">When you woke up this morning, you would not have guessed that this is what you would be doing, but here you are; lowering yourself into the dank recesses of the city sewer system, if only your parents could see you now. 

After wading through the less than palatable sewage water for quite a while, you happen upon a fork in the drain. 

As you look on, you see that the left path leads to a dead end, showcasing a rusty ladder that undoubtably leads up to the world above. The right path, however, only gets darker, with no end in sight. 

You stand still for a moment, close your eyes, and let the surrounding sewer invade your senses. Some feeing unknown wraps around your lungs and tugs you to the . . .

[[Right.|Black Market Path]]

[[Left.|Homeless Witch Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Shop 2 Path" tags="" position="1472,848" size="100,100">Questions fill your head, //What is this? Where am I? Who are you? Why did you leave me that vial? Why did I drink it? Wow, now that I think about it that was a really stupid idea. Who drinks unknown substances wouthout a second thought?//

But before you can voice any of them, she speaks again, &quot;I know you have many questions, but I need you to answer mine first. Did you drink from the vial?&quot;

You nod your head dumbly and she claps her hands once. 

&quot;Perfect, you&#39;re exactly who I&#39;m looking for.&quot;

Finally, you snap out of shock, &quot;Me?&quot;

&quot;Well, of course. Only someone prey to uncensored curiosity would drink a liquid they know nothing about! You have precisely what I&#39;m looking for in an apprentice! So, what do you say?&quot;

You just blink at her. 

//What do I say? I don&#39;t even know where I am!//

She sighs, &quot;I guess you don&#39;t exactly know a lot about //our// reality, you know, with you being a human and all.&quot; 

She then slumps down into a chair, that seems to have materialized out of nowhere, and says with some measure of reluctance, &quot;I can&#39;t tell you anything unless you agree to be my apprentice. If I give you anymore information, it will be harder to erase the memory, should you decline my offer. I need to know . . . are you curious?&quot;

Your mind races. You know nothing about this &quot;reality&quot; she speaks of, or the consequences that come with it, but none the less, you still feel a pull towards whatever adventures this reality might hold. In the end, your answer has to be . . .

[[&quot;Yes.&quot;|Shop 2 yes Path]]

[[&quot;No.&quot;|Shop 2 no Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Shop 2 yes Path" tags="" position="972,894" size="100,100">She jumps up and grabs your hands, &quot;Thank you! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!&quot;

Pulling you along, she weaves through the piles of //things//, all the while talking a mile a minute, &quot;You don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve been looking for an apprentice! It&#39;s been a millenia at least! Anyway, I should get to explaining all--&quot; she stops and waves her hands around, &quot;--this.&quot;

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Her eyes sparkle at this.

You turn to examine the pile closest to you, now, looking at one item in particular, another glass vial sitting atop a stack of freakishly large books (at this point you should be sick of vials, but alas your interest is piqued). In spiraling script its lable reads: //&#39;A sample for the Fountain of Youth&#39;//.

again, you breathe, //&quot;Yes!&quot;//

--

She begins by speaking of the foundation of this //new world//, detailing how, in the beginning, your world and hers were one and the same, but slowly they became separated. There was a great struggle, once, to regain the magic that once thrived in the mortal world, however, as generations passed, the power of mundane life, of routine and monotony, overcame the people. They sank into oblivion, and the connection between the two worlds was lost.

&quot;We are the historians,&quot; She said. &quot;You and I. When our two realities are ready to rejoin, then we will teach them all that the centuries have kept  secret.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; You say to yourself, bewilderment evident in your voice, &quot;That&#39;s the last time i&#39;m having gas station sushi before bed.&quot;

You are almost //dragged// to the right, an impatience that is not your own quickens your steps. 

As you begin to walk to the right, your foot brushes a solid object concealed by the practically opaque sewer water. Unthinking, you bend down and plunge your hand into the lukewarm water, searching around for a //something//. 

Your hand brushes a cold object and you reach once again, this time securing a piece of metal in your grasp. As you look, unhindered, at the contense of your hand, you are surprised to see an intricately carved key resting in the palm of your hand.

(link: &quot;Keep the key.&quot;)[(set: $key to true) (goto: &quot;Black Market Path Next&quot;)]

Taking in your new surroundings, you see that you are in a concrete block of space, boxed in on all sides by towering buildings. 

In the dim light provided by a street lamp in the corner, you see a figure huddled on a cardboard slab. 

You go to place your had on their shoulder (to see if they&#39;re ok, you tell yourself), but a hand grabs your wrist before you can touch them, pulling you down.

Your yelp of alarm is cut off when you see a woman&#39;s weathered face peering up at you, her eyes older than you can fathom. 

After a couple more seconds of awkward eye contact, she speaks.

&quot;You&#39;ll do,&quot; her putrid breath puffs into your face, you don&#39;t have time to react before she grabs a bottle from her pack and pours it on the floor, creating a puddle of luminous liquid. 

She suddenly appears behind you, then whispers, &quot;You will need this, traveler,&quot; and hands you a key. 

You go to ask her what on //earth// she is talking about, but before you can even voice your confusion she is pushing you into the puddle, and you are falling. 

And falling.

And falling.

And falling.

Until, there is only darkness and your labored breathing. 

[[Try to look around.|Black Market Path End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Black Market Path Next" tags="" position="1645,1002" size="100,100">You journey deeper into the sewer, the water level getting progressively higher, your ability to see in front of you getting progressively worse, until you feel your outstretched hand meet a wall.  

You frantically search around the wall for an opening, hoping that a ledge or an out-of-place stone might assist you in your scramble to hoist yourself up, for the water has begun to rise.

Once at your waist, you now feel the water lap at your torso. You need to do something, //fast//. 
(if: $key is true)[\
Suddenly, you remember the key, and in a fit of crazed brilliance, you shove it into a crevice between the rocks, it fits in seamlessly. 

The wall parts and you tumble through with nothing less than gymnast-level grace. The wall closes and you are once again submerged in darkness. 

[[Try to look around.|Black Market Path End]]
]
(if: $key is false)[\
//The key!//

You suddenly realize that the key is exactly what you need, but you are too late, as you turn to race back to where you dropped the key, you see a colossal wave rapidly making its way towards you. You close your eyes and prepare for the inevitable.

The last thing you feel is the force of the wave pushing you against the wall and pulling you under, then everything fades to black. 

End. 

[[Go back to the beginning.|In the beginning]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Black Market Path End" tags="" position="1645,1152" size="100,100">As your eyes focus in the darkness, you see a faint light off in the distance. It seems as though the only thing you can do it is walk towards it. 

As you get closer, you are able to make out the silhouette of a doorway and two semi-transparent flaps covering the hole it makes. 

As soon as you reach to door, you can hear the chatter and bustle of the world beyond the flaps. Curiosity overtakes you and you pull them back to see that you are immerging into a wide, catacomb-like tunnel. Stalls line the walls and in the distance you can see the tunnel branch off in many different directions, crowds of individuals mill around, occasionally ducking onto one stall or another. 

All around you, these people talk animatedly in tongues you can not dream to comprehend and as you look closer, most of them seem to possess attributes of an otherworldly nature, occasionally you will see a slit eye or a mouthful of sharpened teeth.

In your haste to avert your gaze from one such patron, you see a sign hanging from the ceiling that gives a name to this peculiar place: //&#39;The Magic Market of the East Side&#39;//

You dazedly stumble into one of the stalls.

//Magic? What is this place? What was in that vial? How is all of this here? Wow, that bird is pretty--wait--bird?//

You jolt at that thought and realize that you have been staring at a beautiful bird. At closer inspection you realize the bird to be a peacock--no--peacocks don&#39;t glow.  

Its feathers suddenly puff; swirling red eyes lock on you from across the room, where the large animal is perched. 

It looks about ready to charge.

You throw your arms up in an act of self-preservation and the beast immediately freezes, staring at something in your hand.

//The key!//

You slowly inch towards the bird, the key clutched in your shaking hand, and hold it out, a peace offering. 

It wraps its impossibly sharp beak around the key, centimeters from your fingers, and sharply yanks the key towards itself, pulling you with it. 

You trip over your own feet and fall into the bird. 

Prepared for a nasty landing, you are not ready to hit solid ground, with the bird nowhere in sight.

In its place lies a new key tied to a small card. you examine the card and to your surprise the words //&#39;Welcome to the world of secrets, traveler&#39;// glint up at you in graceful, gold cursive.

You walk into a surprisingly modern kitchen, outfitted with a retro-chic refridgerator, a table with two chairs, and a white tile counter, on top of which, is a radio tv.

You sweep your gaze over the room once more and notice that there is also a newspaper that seems to have been carelessly tossed onto the table. 

//Breaking News// catches your eye, and you fully turn to the paper on the table. Just before you take a closer look, the radio produces a few seconds of static grabbing your attention.

[[Turn on the radio.|Werewolf Path]]

--

You open the front door and are immediately surprised by the what you see outside. Instead of a quaint neighborhood and paved roads, you see a redwood forest surrounding you on all sides and a path made of. . . cobblestone?

You race to the edge of the clearing, looking for any possible life beyond the forest line, and are disappointed to find that not even the birds are singing. 

You turn back to reexamine the house you just left, and are once again shocked to find that instead of the out-of-place suburbian house you left, there is a hut made of dirt walls and a hay roof tilting to the left, as if a great breeze could tip it over. 

Suddenly, you hear the beat of wings in the distance, powerful wings that absolutely do //not// belong to a harmless bird. 

In an effort to conceal yourself before the beast with wings arrives, you run for the forest. And just in time, for as soon as you reach the first tree, a //dragon// swoops into the clearing and tramples the hut into the ground. It sneezes, and the pile of rubbish that was once a hut bursts into flames. 

You stand there, gawking at the spectacle, and watch as the giant lizard nods once to itself, as if praising its own work, and jumps into the air again, beats its poweful wings once again, and disappears on the horizon. 

Your shock fades after a while and all that is left is a rumbling in your stomach. You decide to venture into the forest to find berries or something. Anything, really, to tie you over. 

Entering the forest is like stepping into a fairy land (you&#39;re not entirely sure that it //isn&#39;t// a fairy land). The trees are covered in sparkling dew, every manner of flower peaks up at you through winding tree roots and spongy, green moss coats the forest floor. You can&#39;t help but stray from the path.

[[Go back to the beginning.|In the beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Werewolf Path" tags="" position="3477,1076" size="100,100">You grab one of the knobs on the radio and begin fiddling with the channels, flipping the dial this way and that to catch a signal. 

You are about to give in, thinking that the box will produce nothing but static, when a sharp voice abruptly cuts through the fuzzy sound:

//--eaking News, a werewolf gang calling themselves &#39;The Howlers&#39; has successfully robbed a bank and jeweler store, managing to wound 10 people and put 3 in critical condition! Sources say that the werewolves seemed unhinged and dangerous, often stopping in the middle of the heists to bare their teeth and threaten anyone who looked them in the eye--witnesses have claimed that the wolved used only their claws to commit the crime, easily tearing through metal safes to reach the priceless items.

If you find yourself in the presence of a &#39;pack&#39; of werewolves, please do not hesitate to contact the authorities and report these characters! Werewolves can be extremely dangerous and rapidly change emotions! Always be wary! Thank you for listening to this broadcast, I&#39;m Count Vlad, your resident vampire newscas--//

And just as suddenly as the voice appeared, it vanishes.

You slump into one of the chairs and stare at your hands. //Werewolves? Vampires? What IS this world?//

Your terror and confusion morph into denial. //This can&#39;t be real! Someone, somewhere, is pulling a prank!//

You stand up at this, thinking that if you just go outside, there will be a camera crew stationed right beyond the door. //Yeah, I&#39;ll go outside and prove that this is all a hoax!//

You stride through the kitchen, through the living room, and towards the front door. You promptly rip it open, expecting to see at least one sheepish looking camera man huddled on the porch, but no one is there. 

[[Continue.|Continue the Wolf Path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Continue the Wolf Path" tags="" position="3477,1226" size="100,100">You circle the house, positive that you will see a hidden camera in the brush or hanging from a tree, but after your third lap, you are beginning to realize that you are all alone. 

//If I am truly by myself. . .that means that the broadcast I heard over the radio was real. This world is real!//

You reach the front of the house and look past the lawn where a neat pathway leads from the front door into the woods surrounding the house. An undeniable curiosity overtakes you and you begin to jog towards the unknown, leaving the confusing little house behind. 

--

After traveling for a while, you see a sign in the distance that reads: //&#39;Welcome to the town of Boatwrite//, and beyond that, a wall that seems to stretch for miles to the right and left of you, and beyond //that// you see huge glass buildings reaching for the sky. 

This isn&#39;t a town, it&#39;s a city. 

you enter the city and begin to look around, deducing that this place would be similar in layout and design to a major city in your &#39;world&#39;. 

//There are certainly enough people for this to be a major city//.

And there are, sidewalks are packed with people of all shapes and sizes going about their days at their own pace and leisure.

There is something about a lot of them, however, that seems a little off to you. 

You are so occupied, analyzing all of these people, that you don&#39;t notice the poll you almost walk into until you are halted inches from it. It&#39;s then that you see the homemade flyer taped onto the poll, a haphazard //&#39;werewolf rights = justice&#39;// plastered across the page. 

//Oh, right.// you remember, //this place is weird.// 

You look around again, this time with a sharper eye, and see that indeed, many of the civilians walking the streets are sporting one inhuman characteristic or another, be it fangs, gills, or on one occasion, a tail. 

And some individuals seem to be entirely human. 

Before you can read any more into what you&#39;re seeing, a commotion a little ways away catches your attention. 

&quot;Get yer filthy tail outta my restaurant, Mutt!&quot; An older man screams at a young woman. &quot;Your lot ain&#39;t welcome here!&quot;

The young woman looks like she is about to speak up but thinks better of it and instead chooses to slink away in shame. 

You feel an urge to chase after her and ask her why that man treated her so poorly, but you know you&#39;ll just be getting a mouthful of bared teeth as an aswer, so you choose to follow her instead. 

She walks through the streets and down an alley, stopping once to check behind her, you hid under a piece of cardboard, and continues on until she reaches a warehouse-like structure.

You are so occupied with watching what she is going to do next that you don&#39;t aren&#39;t paying attention to your own steps, and your left foot loudly crunches a discarded wine bottle.

She whips around, //&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot;//

You slip on the offending object and crack your head on the hard concrete floor. 

You don&#39;t feel any pain, rather an acute numbness that spreads throughout the rest of your body. 

The last thing you hear is a sharp gasp and footsteps rapidly making their way towards you.

&quot;Oh my gosh! Are you alr--?&quot;

Then everything fades to black. 

End.

[[Go back to the beginning.|In the beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Werewolf Activist Path" tags="" position="3552,1376" size="100,100">You slowly make your way into the light, heart pounding all the while, and look up at the woman. 

&quot;Why are you here?&quot;

&quot;I followed you--&quot;

//&quot;What?&quot;//

&quot;Not like that!&quot; You&#39;re quick to supply, &quot;I just wanted to know what you did to anger that man. He looked livid!&quot;

Her eyes narrowed, &quot;Are you messing with me?&quot;

You shake your head and attempt to adopt the most innocently curious demeanor you can muster. She sighs and says, &quot;Ever since that gang, &#39;The Howlers&#39; caught the media&#39;s attention, werewolves have been labled a problem race. We&#39;ve been forced to leave our jobs or homes, that&#39;s why I--,&quot; She stopped for a moment and looked around. &quot;That&#39;s why I live //here//.

&quot;No one will give us work and a large percentage of the population is convinced that we have rabies. Their prejudices are ruining our lives!&quot; At that she kicked an empty beer can at a wall of the alleyway, frustration evident in her stance. 

You feel devistated to hear that such drastic points of view have been taken by the people, and that the innocent have been abused because of it. A righteous fury bubbles up in you and you turn to her with determination in your eyes. 

&quot;I can help. I&#39;m human--you do have humans here, right?&quot; Her skeptical nod propells you forward, &quot;I&#39;m human, if we, werewolves and humans, work together to dissuade society from putting your people in a negative light, maybe we can abolish the harsh stereotypes around your race!&quot;

Your enthusiasm is contagious and she looks off into the distance with a sparkle in her eye, &quot;Maybe, with time.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; you say, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;

--

Over time you tell her how you are from a different world, where werewolves and vampires are stuff of fantasy, never really believed to be real. She, after much debate, decides to believe you, and tells you all that she can about the world you now live in. 

Two worlds, one human and one of the occult, used to be separate. Gradually, over time, they gind consciousness of one another an decided that it would be most beneficial to interweave the different societies together and create a new reality, one that is made of both occult magic and human science. 

&quot;It was peaceful at first,&quot; She tells you, &quot;But over time the humans became wary of the supernatural abilities that the occult beings possessed, and have attempted to remedy their worries by socially isolating select groups, werewolves included.&quot;

You know that social justice must be achieved, and that you are soon to be part of a movement that will change so much about a world you understand little about, but you are more than ready to learn.

After walking a ways, you spot another hut. This one is concealed by the copious flora of the forest and it takes you a moment to realize that you are actually looking at a hut at all and not a gnarled tree. 

A plume of smoke rises from the opening at the top of the tre--hut, rather--and a neat garden surrounds the little building, giving off a lived-in-yet-well-managed vibe. 

You are immediately taken with the place, and waste no time trotting up to the front door and giving the handle a nice little yank, for some reason you are sure that no one else could possibly be in the hut at this time, so you let yourself in. 

Only to come face to face with a tiny woman in rags seconds later. She grabs a crooked stick from one of the shelves in the room and begins to wave it at you with calculated little flicks of her wrist. Pink bursts of glitter shoot from her stick and surround you, coating your clothes (which, now that you look at them, are rages too) and suddenly you feel light headed, as if you stood up too fast to allow circulation to correctly run its course, and after a few seconds, you feel yourself collapse on the floor in an ungraceful heap. 

--

When you next open your eyes, you see that you are still in the hut, only now, you are confined to a chair with bindings that you can&#39;t actually see, but can feel digging into your flesh. 

Out of the corner of your eye you sense movement and snap your head to the side to see the same little woman staring back at you. After a time, she speaks.

&quot;Did you really think just barging into my home, unannounced might I add, would get you anywhere? Do you not know who I am?&quot; 

&quot;As a matter of fact, I don&#39;t!&quot; Your fear sharpens your words and before you can blink she is upon you.

&quot;Don&#39;t use that disrespectful tone with me, child! I&#39;m the only reason you&#39;re not halfway to the spirit world by now.&quot;

&quot;Spirit world?&quot;

She takes a step back, looking, of all things, sheeish, &quot;I&#39;ve had you under my sleeping spell for a little over a month now. I didn&#39;t know you needed to eat! You died of starvation a couple of days into your slumber and if it wasn&#39;t for my quick thinking, your spirit would have floated on into the other realm.&quot; Her face grew smug, &quot;I managed to trap your essence into a jar just before that happened!&quot;

Your jaw drops in disbelief. //Dead? I&#39;m DEAD!??!?//

Your inner struggle must have shown on your face, for she then says, &quot;Oh, well, now don&#39;t get all worked up! Death comes to us all anyway! Your time jsut came a bit faster. And besides, I repossessed your spirit. As long as you work for me and //only// for me, you can lead a completely normal existence. I promise!&quot;

//Oh my gosh I&#39;m dead! I won&#39;t be able to eat my favorite foods or breathe or--wait, did she say &#39;work for me&#39;?//

Your eyes snap up to meet hers and you speak for the first time, &quot;work for you?&quot;

She smiles and nods, &quot;Of course, you owe me your life! I //am// the one who saved you, you know!&quot; 

At this point, you&#39;re so confused, you can&#39;t fathom a way to answer, and she takes your silence as affirmation. 

&quot;Perfect! We&#39;ll start your training immediately!&quot;

She grabs a pointed hat that had been hanging from one of the chair backs and places her wand on the table, &quot;Now, I have to go out and get a few things from my garden. Don&#39;t. Move.&quot;

She throws open the door and step through the threshold. Leaving you all alone. 

You move your wrist to attempt to shift to a more comfortable position and feel the bindings give way. Your left arm is free and the wand is within reach.

(if: $wand is true)[
To see your outstretched arm, reaching for her wand. Her eyes widen and and she opens her hand. The wand flies into her grip and she begins to vibrate with rage. 

&quot;How dare you attempt to steal MY wand! I can see that my kindness has no effect on your cold heart! I shall banish you to the spirit world where your evil mind can not reach this plane!&quot;

She stabs her wand into the air and drags it downward, pulling open a portal which started to shift and fizzle with instability. 

You feel your body pull towards the unsettling window and she gives you one last shove before you tumble head first into the bottomless chasm of lost spirits. 

The last thing you hear is her whisper, &quot;Ungrateful human.&quot;

Then all is dark. 

End.

(if: $wand is false)[
Her eyes twinkle when she sees your hands against the armrests.

&quot;I knew you were smart.&quot;

Suddenly the bindings on your other hand and feet release and you tumble forward, rubbing your wrists. 

&quot;I will start by telling you this, I do not wish to be your master or your keeper. I would like to teach you what I know and give you my legacy when I pass on to the next world. You are free to learn or adventure. It is all your choice.&quot;

You blink in confusion and she continues, &quot;I needed to incapacitate you at first because I though that you were going to steal my wand. No one steals my wand.&quot; 

When you finally express your ignorance she balks in surprise but then nods in understanding.

&quot;You were going to be a sacrifice for the king. He is a ruthless tyrant who thinks only of appeasing his precious gods and living in wealth. He probably thought bringing you here would please the gods, what a foolish man. But no matter, you are here now and there is much to learn about this world of fantasy and magic. Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;I think . . . I think I am.&quot;

End.
