# BARYS-GWC
This is our project for Girls Who Code. We are creating a called BARYS.
Our goal is to encourage people to read books and convince them that - BOOKS DON'T SUCK!
You will be able to play games to explore different genres.
At the end of each game you will be presented with the list of books that might suit your taste!
